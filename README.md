# A Simple Numeric Calculator
ccalc is nothing fancy or new; just a simple command line calculator written in C over the course of a few hours as an exercise in parsing expressions based on lexical conventions using the call stack to traverse a syntax tree. Order of operations is fully respected, including the unary negation operator.

## Building
Just use `make`; the executable `ccalc` will be created.

## Usage
After running `ccalc` from the command line, you will be met with a prompt. Enter a mathematical expression and the result will be evaluated and printed. Press `Ctrl + D` to exit.
